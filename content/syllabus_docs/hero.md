## Overview

The goal of this course is to prepare students for the Basic Qualification Exam. There will be two lectures a week. Lectures will be focused on both the theory and problem solving techniques for problems that frequently show up on the analysis and linear algebra portion of the basic. There will be a heavier emphasis on the analysis portion of the exam. 

Starting in week 2, students will be given a **weekly** **quiz** during the first 10 minutes of the course on Mondays. 

Students will also be broken into groups of 3 biweekly and assigned **weekly** **group** **homework** related to the lecture material.  

There will also be **one** **four** **hour** proctored **exam** during the quarter during week 5. This is done to replicate the qualification exam test setting. 

Students will also be given **two** old basic qualification exams during week 3 and 7. Students will spend four hours attempting the exam. Afterwards, another peer will grade their exam. This portion will be graded for completion.

In addition, starting in week 2 every student will meet Thierry two times throughout the quarter in a **one on one meeting for 30 minutes each time**. In this meeting, students will be asked to either solve previous homework problems.

## Weekly Quizzes

Starting in week 2, students will have a quiz at the first lecture of the week except for during the midterm week. This quiz will be in the first 10 minutes of the lecture and will consist of a random problem chosen to be very similar to a homework problem from the previous homework. In general, there will be no makes up for the quizzes. However, exceptions can be made based on the circumstances. And the two lowest quiz score will be dropped.

## Group Homework

Students will be randomly broken into groups of three every two weeks. The homework will be typically 9 questions per week and **each** group member has to write up roughly three questions per assignment. All group members will receive the same grade. This is to encourage students to double check each others proofs. Thierry will provide detailed feedback on the homework problems. Each group will be allowed to resubmit non-full score questions twice. In addition, every question on the homework should be at least a $9/10$ by the final submission. You will have one week after you get your homework or re-submission to resubmit it.

## Exams

There will be **one** in person proctored exams during the middle of the quarter. This midterm will be **four hours** long. The purpose of these exams is to replicate the test taking scenario one has during the basic qualification exam. Make up exams will be permitted only under exceptional circumstances. Please let me know as soon as possible if you cannot make the exam dates.

Students will also be given an old basic qualification exam during week 3 and 7. They will have one week to spend four hours attempting to solve the exam. Afterwards, their exams will be graded by a peer. These two unproctored exams are graded for **completion**.

## Grade

Your grade will be determined by the following scheme: 35% Homework, 15% quiz, 10% presentations, 10% old qualification exams, and 30% midterm.

For analysis we will mainly use Professor Monica Visan's lecture notes for honors Real Analysis 1 and 2.

For linear algebra, we will mainly use [Axler](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6). The main weakness of this book is that it does not provide sufficient background on Jordan Normal Forms and Determinants that are tested on the basic. We will use chapters 4 and 7 of  [Friedberg](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/linear-algebra/P200000006185/9780137515424) to cover these topics.
