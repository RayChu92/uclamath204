##Group Homework

You will be randomly assigned into a group of three every two weeks. There will be weekly homeworks of roughly 9 questions assigned on Wednesday and due the following **Wednesday**. Each group submits **one** assignment to me at the end of the class. And **each** group member has to write up at least 3 questions and indicate on their assignment who wrote the solutions for each question. All group members will receive the same grade. This is to encourage you to double check your group member's proofs and to talk to each other about methods of solving the problems. Thierry will provide detailed feedback on the homework problems. Each group will be allowed to resubmit non-full score questions twice. In addition, every question on the homework should be at least a 9/10 by the final submission. You will have one week after you get your homework or re-submission to resubmit it.

## Weekly Quizzes

Starting in week 2, you will have a quiz on every **Wednesday** except for the midterm week. This quiz will be in the first 10 minutes of the class and will consist of a randomly chosen problem from the previous homework. In general, there will be no makes up for the quizzes. However, exceptions can be made based on the circumstances. And the two lowest quiz score will be dropped. 

If a student performs unsatisfactory on a quiz, then the student needs to talk to me privately. This is done to check up on the student and I will notify the student via email.

## Presentations

Starting in week 2, students will meet Thierry in a 20 minute one on one meeting where he will ask you to solve previous homework problems on the board. Each student will meet Thierry 3 times throughout the quarter for these presentations. If a student struggles during the presentation, then the student needs to talk to me privately.  This is done to check up on the student and I will notify the student via email. 

## Midterm

There will be **one** in person proctored exams during the middle of the quarter. This midterm will be **four hours** long. The purpose of these exams is to replicate the test taking scenario one has during the basic qualification exam. Make up exams will be permitted only under exceptional circumstances. Please let me know as soon as possible if you cannot make the exam dates.

## Practice Exams

You will also be given an old basic qualification exam during week 3 and 7. You will have one week to spend four hours on solving the exam. Afterwards, your exam will be graded by a peer. These two practice exams are graded for **completion**.

## Grade

Your grade will be determined by the following scheme: 35% Homework, 30% midterm, 15% quiz, 10% presentations, and 10% practice exams.

For linear algebra, we will mainly use [Axler](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6). The main weakness of this book is that it does not provide sufficient background on Jordan Normal Forms and Determinants that are tested on the basic. We will use chapters 4 and 7 of  [Friedberg](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/linear-algebra/P200000006185/9780137515424) to cover these topics.
