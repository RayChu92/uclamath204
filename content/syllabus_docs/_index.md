## Overview

The goal of this course is to prepare you for the Basic Qualification Exam. There will be two lectures a week. Lectures will be focused on both the theory and problem solving techniques for problems that frequently show up on the analysis and linear algebra portion of the basic. There will be a heavier emphasis on the analysis portion of the exam. 

Starting in week 2, you will have a **weekly** **quiz** during the first 10 minutes of the course on Mondays. 

You will also be randomly assigned into homework groups of 3 or 4 biweekly. There will be weekly homework due on the following Wednesday at the end of class. Each group submits **one** homework assignment. I will send an email about the group pairings. 

There will also be **one** **four** **hour** proctored **exam** during the quarter during week 5. This is done to replicate the qualification exam test setting. 

You will also be given **two** old basic qualification exams during week 3 and 7. You will spend four hours attempting the exam. Afterwards, another peer will grade their exam. These two exams are graded for completion.

In addition, starting in week 2 every student will meet Thierry two times throughout the quarter in a **one on one meeting for 30 minutes each time**. In this meeting, you will be asked to solve previous homework problems.

## Weekly Quizzes

Starting in week 2, you will have a quiz on **Wednesday** except for during the midterm week. This quiz will be in the first 10 minutes of the lecture and will consist of a random problem chosen from the previous homework. In general, there will be no makes up for the quizzes. However, exceptions can be made based on the circumstances. And the two lowest quiz score will be dropped.

## Group Homework

You will be assigned into a group of three or four every two weeks. The homework will be typically 9 questions per week and **each** group member has to write up roughly an equal portion of the questions per assignment. All group members will receive the same grade. This is to encourage you to double check your group member's proofs. Thierry will provide detailed feedback on the homework problems. Each group will be allowed to resubmit non-full score questions twice. In addition, every question on the homework should be at least a 9/10 by the final submission. You will have one week after you get your homework or re-submission to resubmit it.

## Exams

There will be **one** in person proctored exams during the middle of the quarter. This midterm will be **four hours** long. The purpose of these exams is to replicate the test taking scenario one has during the basic qualification exam. Make up exams will be permitted only under exceptional circumstances. Please let me know as soon as possible if you cannot make the exam dates.

You will also be given an old basic qualification exam during week 3 and 7. They will have one week to spend four hours attempting to solve the exam. Afterwards, their exams will be graded by a peer. These two unproctored exams are graded for **completion**.

## Grade

Your grade will be determined by the following scheme: 35% Homework, 15% quiz, 10% presentations, 10% old qualification exams, and 30% midterm.

For analysis we will mainly use Professor Monica Visan's lecture notes for honors Real Analysis 1 and 2.

For linear algebra, we will mainly use [Axler](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6). The main weakness of this book is that it does not provide sufficient background on Jordan Normal Forms and Determinants that are tested on the basic. We will use chapters 4 and 7 of  [Friedberg](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/linear-algebra/P200000006185/9780137515424) to cover these topics.
